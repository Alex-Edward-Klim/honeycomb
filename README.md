# Honeycomb

Another hex grid library made in JavaScript, heavily inspired by [Red Blob Games'](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) code samples.

All existing JS hex grid libraries I could find are coupled with some form of view. Most often a `<canvas>` element or the browser DOM. I want more separation of concerns...and a new hobby project to spend countless hours on.

## TODO

1. Maybe create a Cube function that only works with x, y and z coordinates. This places all cube coordinate related functionality in a separate module.
