     * @function Grid
     *
     * @description
     * Factory function for creating a grid (singular). It currently only supports a single grid, because it sets size, orientation and origin for **all** hexes. Several "shape" methods are exposed that return an array of hexes in a certain shape.
     *
     * A grid is *viewless*, i.e.: it's an abstract grid with undefined dimensions. If you want to render a tangible grid, use a View factory (e.g. the {@link Views.DOM|DOM view}) by passing it a grid instance.
     *
     * @param {Object} options       An object containing a `hex` property
     * @param {Object} options.hex   An object that can contain a size, orientation and origin.
     * This will be refactored ðŸ˜¬
     *
     * @returns {Object} An object with helper methods like: translating 2-dimensional points to hex coordinates and generating arrays of hexes in a certain shape.
     *
     * @example
     * import { Grid, Point } from 'Honeycomb'
     *
     * Grid({
     *     hex: {
     *         size: 10,                // passed to Hex#size
     *         orientation: 'pointy',   // passed to Hex#orientation
     *         origin: Point(0, 0)      // passed to Hex#origin
     *     }
     * })
