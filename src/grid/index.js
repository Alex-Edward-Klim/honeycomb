/**
 * @function Grid
 *
 * @description
 * Factory function for creating a grid (singular). It currently only supports a single grid, because it sets size, orientation and origin for **all** hexes. Several "shape" methods are exposed that return an array of hexes in a certain shape.
 *
 * A grid is *viewless*, i.e.: it's an abstract grid with undefined dimensions. If you want to render a tangible grid, use a View factory (e.g. the {@link Views.DOM|DOM view}) by passing it a grid instance.
 *
 * @param {Object} options       An object containing a `hex` property
 * @param {Object} options.hex   An object that can contain a size, orientation and origin.
 * This will be refactored ðŸ˜¬
 *
 * @returns {Object} An object with helper methods like: translating 2-dimensional points to hex coordinates and generating arrays of hexes in a certain shape.
 *
 * @example
 * import { Grid, Point } from 'Honeycomb'
 *
 * Grid({
 *     hex: {
 *         size: 10,                // passed to Hex#size
 *         orientation: 'pointy',   // passed to Hex#orientation
 *         origin: Point(0, 0)      // passed to Hex#origin
 *     }
 * })
